💎 You too are nostalgic for the era of GTA 360 mods so I offer you this theme which aims to best resemble the original menu (Superior V) on xbox 360 JTAG.🔥🧨

⚠️⚠️ The screenshot of the second header including the video are with the old FONT which is not the original, this problem is patched in 0.2.

💎 The color of the HEADER and FOOTER is fully customizable!!✨
